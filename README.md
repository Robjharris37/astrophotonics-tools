# astrophotonics-tools
A set of tools for use in Astrophotonics.

This is very much an early work in progress, with the idea being to eventually create a python module simliar to astropy/aotools that will allow the user a powerful convenient way to do  astrophotonics calculations.

Initial ideas for modules

# modes
V number
Number of modes in fibre
Modes at telescope

# Coupling
Overlap integral stuff

# Reformatters

# Convert between code types
- Based upon Edoardo Rizzardi work. Will upload when finished.

# AWG
Munoz simluation tool

# Integrate into/from other frameworks

Paper by Gehring+ 2019 (incl. Matthias) gives a nice overview about available software:

They have their published code (https://pypi.org/project/gdsHelpers), there is also IPKISS (http://www.ipkiss.org/), though discontinued 2013.
