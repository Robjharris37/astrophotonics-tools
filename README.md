# astrophotonics-tools
A set of tools for use in Astrophotonics. 

This is very much an early work in progress, with the idea being to eventually create a python module simliar to astropy/aotools that will allow the user a powerful convenient way to do simple astrophotonics calculations.

Inital ideas for modules

# modes
V number
Number of modes in fibre
Modes at telescope

# Coupling
Overlap integral stuff

# Reformatters

# Convert between code types

# AWG
Munoz simluation tool
