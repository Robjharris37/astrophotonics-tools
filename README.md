# astrophotonics-tools
A set of tools for use in Astrophotonics. 

This is very much a work in progress, with the idea being to eventually create a python module simliar to astropy/aotools that will allow the user a powerful convenient way to do simple astrophotonics calculations.

Inital ideas for modules

#modes
V number
Number of modes
Modes at telescope

#Fibres
Overlap integral stuff

#Reformatters

#Convert between code types
