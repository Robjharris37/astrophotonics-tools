# astrophotonics-tools
A set of tools for use in Astrophotonics.

This is very much an early work in progress, with the idea being to eventually create a python module simliar to astropy/aotools that will allow the user a powerful convenient way to do  astrophotonics calculations.

Current organisation

# Fabry Perot
Equations relating to Fabry-Perot etalons

# fiber_calcs  
Equations for fibers

# Gaussian optics
Useful Gaussian beam approximations

# general
Generally useful aotools

# glasses
Refractive index approximations mode_matching

# Modes
Equations relating to modes

## Future additions:

# Overlap calcs
Based upon work by Silvia Menghi

# modes
Based upon work by Mark Corrigan

# Convert between code types
- Based upon Edoardo Rizzardi work. Will upload when finished.

# AWG
Munoz simluation tool

# Also wish to integrate into/from other frameworks

Paper by Gehring+ 2019 (incl. Matthias) gives a nice overview about available software:

They have their published code (https://pypi.org/project/gdsHelpers), there is also IPKISS (http://www.ipkiss.org/), though discontinued 2013.
